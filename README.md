# Create a form in Node.js
<!--endhide-->

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, Node, express, or express-generator.

Let's create a form that is rendered from node/express using the node's `Embedded JavaScript templates` handler.

The idea is to create with Bootstrap render the different elements within the designer and pass the data to display dynamically, all the elements must be loaded in a main view called home.ejs
  
## ðŸŒ±  How to start this project

a) Configure express from scratch.

b) Create the project using express-generator.

ðŸ’¡ Important: save your code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.

## Strategy

Take a few minutes to analyze ðŸ¤¯ the image and draw your strategy on it, identify the components that you are going to use from bootstrap.

Once the strategy is finished you can start coding! Start programming ðŸŽŠ!
